	<p>Thank you all for coming and listening, and thank you especially to our student organizers and 
	to Sandy for helping me with this speech. </p>
	
	<p>My name is Andy Leifer. I am a tutor here. And I am also a scientist. A few years ago, I read 
	about an especially beautiful experiment by a researcher at Cornell, named Brian Wansink, who 
	was trying to understand how our minds and bodies determine when we have had enough to eat.</p>
	
	<p>Brian Wansink invited people to his test restaurant for tomato soup. Each person was 
	encouraged to eat as much soup as they wanted. Waiters had more at their ready refill their 
	bowls.  Half of the participants received regular bowls while the other half received bowls with a 
	secret hidden tube in the bottom so that as they ate, their soup was slowly and imperceptibly re- 
	filling.  As a result, you would have to eat much more soup to empty the re-filling bowl than the 
	regular bowl. (How is it that they  didn't notice the tube, you ask? Well they were told that the 
	restaurant was experimenting with new place settings and were asked not to move the dishes 
	around.) In any event, after a tasty meal of soup, they found that the  participants with 
	automatically refilling bowls ate almost twice as much as those who ate from normal bowls. Yet 
	when participants were asked to estimate how much  they thought they ate, both groups reported 
	about the same amount. Moreover, both groups felt similarly full after their meal. In other 
	words, people ate twice as much food  and didn't even realize it, only because their bowls didn't 
	appear to be emptying as quickly! Wansink and his colleagues concluded that we rely heavily on 
	visual cues to determine how much we eat and when to stop.</p> 
	
	<p>This is fascinating because it says something about ourselves. But I get even more excited about 
	it because it's a brilliant example of experimental science!</p> 
	
	<p>This experiment has all the right ingredients: It addressed head on the question at hand, namely 
	can visual cues effect our eating? The evidence is direct and easy to quantify:  The group with 
	refilling bowls ate more. The experiment had a built-in randomized control. And in general it 
	was simple, elegant and straightforward even to the point of seeming obvious in retrospect. Yet 
	 the underlying question of how we choose how much to eat is neither simple nor obvious. This 
	was a very clever design.</p>
	
	<p>Moreover, it is this same cleverness of design that is a hallmark of some of the  most celebrated experiments in history, like Isaac Newton's  two-prism experiment that demonstrated the  nature of light and color, or Harvard's own Meselsohn-Stahl experiment which demonstrated the  nature of DNA. And it is this simplicity and elegance that I aspire to in my own scientific work.</p>
	<p>So, as you can tell,  I got really excited about this Brian Wansink guy. I went out and got his 
	book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindless-Eating-More-Than-Think/dp/0345526880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1298084358&sr=8-1">Mindless Eating: Why we eat more than we think.</a>" And I learned that Wansink doesn't 
	stop with soup.  He goes on to show that we eat more popcorn if it is served in a bigger bowl. 
	And that the identical brownies tastes better when they are served on fine china instead of 
	napkins. He also shows that even seemingly minor environmental factors can have dramatic 
	effects on our perception of food. In another clever experiment, two groups were given identical 
	complimentary glasses of 2 buck chuck wine. One group was told that they were receiving 
	California wine while the other was told they were receiving North Dakota wine. The group that 
	received California wine not only claimed that their wine tasted better. They also claimed that 
	their food tasted better. They also ended up eating more and sitting longer and enjoying their 
	meal more.</p>
	
	<p> These are great experimental designs that we as a university should really be teaching our 
	students. But tragically you won't find Mindless Eating in Harvard Library. I know because 
	when I wanted to read Mindless Eating, the library was the first place I checked. After buying my 
	own copy, I did what  I've done before when  Harvard lacks a book that I think is truly important, 
	I went online and filed a library book request. As you may know, Harvard is the third largest 
	library in the United States. In the past they have readily purchased my recommendations. This 
	time, however, I found the following reply in my Inbox:</p>
	
	<p><i>"Dear Sir. Widener generally does not purchase self help guidebooks of the type you request 
	below."</i></p>
	
	<p>I was shocked. Harvard Library seemed to be implying that the Harvard community was too 
	good for self-help! </p>
	
	<p>I think this is a mistake.</p>
	
	<p>Even Harvard can use a little self-help from time to time. And I think this strikes at a bigger 
	issue.</p>
	
	<p>It's very easy to sit in a laboratory or a library and say..." a book about why eat more than we 
	think? Clearly that can't be science! That can't have academic merit!" But the truth is science 
	and good scientific experimentation can be anywhere that someone takes the time and effort to 
	carry them out. And it behooves us to keep an open mind and learn from exemplary work 
	wherever we find if.</p>
	
	<p>So if I ever get to teach a class on experimental methods, this will be the first reading I plan to 
	assign. And in the meantime, if anyone wants to borrow my book, just find me after the talk. I 
	recommend it.</p>
	
	<p>Thanks!</p> 
	
	
	
	

	<h2><a name="ethan"></a>Ethan Townsend Memorial Service, Ashland Oregon, 20 September 2009</h2>
	<p>Ethan and I met during our freshman year in the dorms at Stanford. I could tell right away that we were going to be great friends. To begin with, we both had identical matching plaid bedsheets. I guess both Mary and my mom shopped at the same stores. In any event our friendship took off from there and Ethan in fact became my best friend. We lived together through college and we traveled all over after graduation.</p>
	<p>Mary asked me to speak a bit about Ethan in the context of Stanford  and our time together as roommates and college students. So what I'm going to try to do is share some stories and memories about Ethan to remind you all of what you already know, which is that Ethan was a truly caring, compassionate and utterly brilliant individual.  When I tell stories about Ethan they sometimes sound almost like tall tales. His whole being seems extraordinary and that's really what it was. All of his friends knew it and we were completely in awe of it as much then as now. And in some ways I think Ethan also deep down knew that he was a bit extraordinary too. That's why when Ethan, Tina and I were traveling across Europe, in our travel blog, I would sign my name "Andy," Tina would sign her name "Tina" but Ethan, he would sign HIS name "Ethan!" with an exclamation point. That exclamation point captures the essence of Ethan. He lived his life with an exclamation point!</p>
	<p>Ethan fundamentally cared about others. He was the guy who, if he heard you were having a bad day, or maybe just a rough quarter he would go out and do something about it, like maybe make a card or send you a photo or drop in just to say hi. But being Ethan, this wouldn't be  just any old card or photo. With Ethan, you would receive a 6ft by 10ft wall sized butcher paper Birthday card, or maybe a poster photomosaic composed of every photo ever taken of you. He would always work in something a little zany or larger than life to make you smile and realize that someone really cared. In talking with my classmates over the past few weeks I've heard variations of this story over and over again and it shows that Ethan truly had a unique ability of connecting with people and make them feel better.</p>
	<p>In my experience, when things weren't going so well Ethan had a way of making the world a less scary and confusing.</p>
	<p>For example, during my junior year I was going through a tough breakup.  I was a bit of a wreck, but Ethan was there for me every single day. I have never met a more patient and thoughtful listener. Ever since then, I have found comfort knowing that whenever things go really bad, Ethan is always at most a phone call away. Even after his death, I found myself reaching for the phone to talk to him to make sense of it all. That's something that I've grown to rely on and its something that I'm really going to miss. In fact, pretty much everything was better when you had Ethan around. I think that's why everyone always wanted him to come along. And, one of the greatest things about Ethan was that he was always ready to go! You could go up to Ethan anytime night and day and say, "Let's go play Frisbee or climb a wall! Jump on a roof." "Hey Ethan, let's road trip to Santa Barbara!"  "Watch sappy chick-flick movies with the girls." He was always willing to drop whatever he was doing for an adventure with a friend. </p>
	<p>For my friends especially, a large part of the community we had in college we owe to  Ethan and his insistence on placing friends first.  One of the things I will miss most about Ethan is his unique combination of quirkiness and  self-confidence. For example, one year we decided to name all of the furniture in our dorms, just for fun. We would sit on Fred the Futon, print with Peppy the Printer and prop open Dirk the Door. Ethan also had these wonderful mannerisms that were just great to be around. If you were ever in a group with Ethan and came to a fork in the road or an awkward pause, Ethan would look left then right and shout "SCATTER!!" and then run around in circles. Which proved to be very effective technique when we were lost in foreign countries. Ethan's personality brought out the inner child in all of us and added a sense of levity and adventure to our lives.</p>
	<p>As soon as you got to know Ethan, a lot of these traits immediately shone through. He cared for others. He went out of his way to brighten peoples day with posters and photos. And he had all these zany quirks. But what took me a lot longer to realize was just how brilliant and talented Ethan was at pretty much everything he ever attempted. I wasn't the only one to pick up on this.</p>
	<p>When a journalists called me last week to interview me about Ethan we got to chatting and she said, "Yaknow, I've never reported on anyone like this before. I talk to one person, and he says 'I knew Ethan through orchestra he was the most talented cellist I ever met.' Another person says, 'He was on my track and soccer team. He was our star athlete' and the third person says he was the 'most brilliant student of his class'."  Every story the journalist heard was different but there was one common thread: at whatever Ethan pursued, he excelled.   Also he never got mired in one subject for long. He would always surprise you with the next skill, his next passion. And let me tell you how those passions varied. One day he would be reading the entire works of Isaac Asimov, the next day it would be James Joyce, and the next day the Bhag-vat-gi-ti and then after that Confucious. It seemed as though he was knowledgeable on every topic. Sophomore year, for example, he decided to sit in on a graduate level philosophy course just for fun. Even though he wasn't taking it for a grade and was the only undergrad in the class, he wrote a final paper, got an A and the professor wrote a whole paragraph of praise in the margins. And on our most recent trip to France this winter, Ethan checked out those Rosetta Stone CD-roms from the library and managed to learn enough  French on the 12 hour flight to negotiate in French in the Parisian marketplace.</p>
	<p>Ethan also had an unsatiable passion for projects. He was a skilled engineer and inventor. I'm sure Joe will go into more details here, but I had to just mention in passing the pully system that Ethan built to turn the light switch on and off from his bunk bed. Or the RAID computer server that we built  inside our little minifridge because the servers' 7 colling fans were  too loud for our small dorm room. Joe will talk about the wireless robot with the creepy little webcam eye that twitches back and forth to see you  and the computerized navigation system that Ethan built from scratch for his car, including an infrared night vision system for headlight-less driving.  You could not hold Ethan's curiosity or creativity in. Traditional doors, locks and walls were nothing to him. Literally. Ethan was a master lockpicker and he could scale the sides of buildings or crawl through steam tunnels. You never knew when those skills will come in handy. It was as if the whole world was Ethan's playground.</p>
	<p>And that was just in his spare time. When it came to academics, Ethan really came unto his own. We took quantum mechanics together junior year. For me this was the hardest class I have ever taken. Ethan never took notes, he never studied and he didn't even own the books. When we did problemsets together in a big study group, Ethan would be the last to start and the first to finish and he would always do well on the exams. </p>
	<p>One of the reasons it took so long to realize that Ethan was a prodigy was because he was never trying to flaunt it. In conversation he never said, "No your wrong. Your way off." Even though he could have said that 9 times out of ten. Instead, he had a way of saying, "Yeah. Its kindof like that, let me show you." that made you feel good and that taught you something valuable at the same time. </p>
	<p>He was everyone's tutor.  He helped entire draw-groups work through organic chemistry and physics and when I started tutoring and TAing classes Ethan was the first person I went to for tips. In fact, it was a good thing Ethan was such a wonderful teacher and a joy to be around because it is was what made it bearable to work with someone who was just so vastly superior at everything you every tried to do. For example, after he accomplished some amazing technical feat, Ethan would say ,"Oh this is nothing, I'm sure you could do it ten times better," and he would say this with such conviction that occasionally we even believed him. And once in awhile, I did find a time when I could actually help teach something to Ethan. For senior formal, Mary mailed Ethan a tuxedo and I loaned him a nice pair of dress shoes, and I told him, "Ok Ethan, you have to give yourself some time to put on the tux, its complicated." And he said "C'mon. Its a tuxedo, how hard can it be." And I said "Ok fine." And I headed out early with my date up to San Francisco. Well during the train ride up, I got this phone call from Ethan, who says "Andy, help me for the life of me I cannot figure out how to make these buttons work!" So, via cell phone, I walked him through how to put the special tuxedo stud buttons on. He may have gotten me through quantum mechanics but I helped him put his tux on. That was a proud moment for me. When I think of Ethan, I picture him hanging out in the hammock he installed under his bunk bed  with the biggest smile on his face as he described some crazy idea. It was times like these when we planned out our future trips and adventures, like the Mongol rally, a ten thousand mile race from Spain to Mongolia.  It saddens me to think that I will never go on another adventure with Ethan.</p>
	<p>The last time I saw Ethan, about a month ago in Boulder we had dinner over burgers and we discussed one of our favorite topics which is how to lead a meaningful life.  As usual, we covered lots if interesting options, like traveling the world, starting a company, going to Law school, but in the end, Ethan made it clear that ultimately the only meaningful thing for him was family. In retrospect this is quite inspiration. Here is a person who could have done anything, won a Nobel Prize, started the next Google, you name it. And it was touching to hear him say how important his family was in his life, and how he was really looking forward to a family of his own.  Which is obviously a testament to Mary, Scooter and Hannah. Anyway, we joked about how my kids were going look forward to seeing Uncle Ethan and how he had better not spoil them all. </p>
	<p>It is especially tragic that Ethan will never have that kind of family of his own, but in a way, as one of our friends who couldn't be here pointed out,  Ethan was able to  raise a different sort of family already in his own short life. And it consists of all of these family members and friends here who are so much closer today because of him than they ever would be.</p>
	<p>And finally I just have to add in a word about Ashland Oregon, the town he loved. Its clear where Ethan got some of his generosity, it is from all of you Ashlanders who have been so generous and helpful and opened your doors and offered places to stay to all of us out-of-towners and who, I am told, have been so helpful to Mary and Scooter.</p>
	<p>I loved Ethan very much. His loss leaves a gaping hole in my life that I imagine will be there for a long time. I am just honored to have been his friend. I always thought we were going to be friends for a life and the way I look at it we always will be. </p>
	<p> Ethan with an exclamation point had a phrase he would like to say that in retrospect really captured his philosophy. He  would say, "Go Team!" </p>
	<p>And so to all of you, I say "Go Team!" and thank you very much.</p>	
	



<h2><a name="physics"></a>Stanford University Physics Department Graduation, 17 June 2007</h2>
<p>Good afternoon. First of all, thank you so much to all of the family and friends that showed up today. Thank you as well to Professor Wojcicki, Professor Burchat and of course our amazing undergraduate administrator Elva, who from where I stand at least, appears to be running the entire show. And thanks also to the  entire Stanford physics department.</p>

<p>
I am quite honored to be standing here today. In fact, when I first received  the email from Elva that I had been chosen by my peers to give this speech, I was very much surprised. I never saw myself as the "typical" physics major. I certainly did not excel beyond my peers in my academics, nor did the subject of physics come particularly easily to me. Upper-level quantum mechanics, for example, was by far *the* greatest intellectual challenge of my entire life. But I have always enjoyed the challenge and the understanding that comes from physics and in particular, I love the feeling of looking back on an interesting problem and thinking to myself, "Wow! I actually understand that!" </p>

<p>
So in my brief time allotted here, I will first try to convey to you what its like to be a physics major at Stanford and share with you my experience in this friendly community. Second, I'll talk a little bit about why a bachelor's in physics represents such a significant achievement and why I believe the undergraduate physics program here prepares us to survive and succeed in almost *any* field. Finally, I will try to share with you some of the insights that I have learned about what it means to be joining an international community of scientists. Hopefully I can inspire some of you to more fully appreciate the privilege and responsibility that this position entails.</p>

<p>Starting out in the physics program at Stanford can be quite intimidating. I constantly found myself surrounded by brilliant individuals. During late not problem-set sessions people would talk about their patents and publications and so forth.  And if that wasn't intimidating enough, there was always somebody prominently wearing their "International Physics Olympiad Champion" t-shirt in lecture to remind you that you were in talented company. But in spite of this, or perhaps because of this, everyone in the physics community was friendly collegial and always helpful. I'm told that some subjects on campus are cut-throat and competitive. This couldn't be farther from the truth in physics.   My fellow classmates were supportive. We studied together, did problem sets together and sincerely wanted to see each other succeed. More than once I relied on a fellow classmate for a morale-boosting pep-talk or trip to Jamba Juice after a particularly jarring exam. </p>

<p>This supportive community extended to professors as well. Through the physics department I have been fortunate to have adopted many advisors and mentors. In my capacity as President of the Society of Physics Student I have had the honor of working with professors such as Rick Pam and Doug Osheroff to plan guest lectures and events. The faculty I have interacted with have been caring, passionate and engaging. Just as an example, Professor Osheroff helped arrange a VIP tour of SLAC for students, but of course he didn't just arrange it. He was an active participant. He was REALLY excited. He asked lots of question and wandered into corridors and asked if we could go see what was overt here or how bout over there. It was great to have faculty and students engaged outside the classroom.</p>

<p>I appreciate the supportive nature of the physics community but I also appreciate their unique sense of humor. One time in honors freshman Mechanics our professor David Goldhaber Gordon told us some physics joke. (By the way, Professors Goldhaber Gordon signs his emails DG^2, but in my problem-set group, ever since we covered Simple Harmonic Motion, DG^2 was *always* referred to as David "Oscillator" Goldhaber Gordon, the Big D-O double G.) Anyway so D-o-double-g told us this famous physics joke that goes on and on about some farmer who needs help from a physicist to get more milk from his cow and the punch line is.. "Well first we approximate the cow as a sphere."</p>

<p>And its not that funny. In fact I still don't get it, though I have heard this same joke from physicists both before and since. But I will tell you a story that IS funny. </p>

<p>One day a drawmate pops his head in the dorm and explains that he heard from his friend at UC Davis that cow tipping is all a myth. A single human is NOT  actually strong enough to physically tip a cow. My roommate, being a Stanford physics major is immiediatel intrigued. He gets out his pencil and paper and he starts making order-of-magnitude estimates about the force a human can lift, the  mass of the average cow and the height of a typical human. He starts drawing the force-body diagram, and he says "Ok.. so the first step"'oyou can probably see where this is going---"is you approximate the cow as a sphere." At that point I fell off my chair laughing. </p>

<p>The cow story is important though. The physics majors here study this material because they love it and they make sure they have a good time along the way.</p>

<p>Not everyone made it through the physics program. Of my 5 probelmset-mates in DG^2's class, I am the only one who stuck with the major. The rest are now in econ, engineering or other fields. But in some ways that is representative of a valuable trait of physics that I have grown to appreciate. Physics trains you well, and the skills it demands are universally applicable. The Stanford physics major forces you to push beyond your comfort level. It teaches you to take whatever tools you may have and apply them to problems or situations that you may be wholly unfamiliar with. This is a valuable life-lesson and it is a useful approach in any discipline. And if you happen to know how to deal with spheres, than perhaps a cow really is kind of like a sphere. (To be fair, my roommate approximated the cow as a sphere with  two legs.. so it was a little more complicated than that.)</p>

<p>Regardless, in my own short time at Stanford I have already capitalized on my background in physics and applied it to other areas. I have cultivated an interest in security policy and global issues. I found, to my surprise, that my background in physics was a huge asset in the policy community and opened countless doors. When I went to Washington DC I was able to get an amazing internship working with physicists at the American Association for the Advancement of Science who try to keep congress and the government informed about the science underlying important security issues. For example, while in DC I worked on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control.  I also tried to set up joint scientific research projects with North Korea to try to bring scientists there into the folds of the international scientific community. Over the past year I have been conducting research into the role that scientists have played on international security issues. To my surprise, I found that scientists and physicists in particular have a long proud history of advising their governments and working across political boundaries to maintain peace and ease tensions in times of hostility. </p>

<p>During the Cold War, Soviet and American scientists built off a strong pre-existing international scientific network to hammer out arms control agreements and tackle thorny security problems such as verifying a test ban or exposing the dangers of anti-ballistic missile defense systems. </p>

<p>I found that scientists could often succeed where diplomats and government officials had failed because they all shared a common problem-solving approach that was not held hostage by national ideologies or artificially imposed political realities. Moreover, when Igor Tamm and Hans Bethe sat across the table from one another in 1958 at an arms control conference in Geneva they already held one another in high esteem and respected each other professionally and thus were able to work out solutions that diplomats may not have. The story is somewhat more nuanced, and I encourage you to read my 100 page thesis on the matter, but the gist is that scientists speak a common language and share a common world view that extends beyond any borders. As such they are uniquely situated to work towards solving international issues.</p>

<p>When we graduate today with our degrees in physics we are joining that international community. There is certainly no shortage of issues to work on.  I encourage you to view your diploma as a ticket into this international scientific community and I hope you will use it well. It represents a significant accomplishment. I'm proud to make it this far and I can't wait to hear where you all are off to next.</p>

<p>Thanks again. Congratulations.</p>
